// The About Me Page - Location for infomation about the creator behind the website. 

// The Bio of the About Me Page
const aboutText = `I am Ed__d w/o the War, a Cameroonian-American born on the East Coast with a passion to create since childhood. 
  From an early age, I made comic books, wrote short stories, created rough draft scripts for movies I never filmed, and drew random
  characters inspired by either my favorite animated shows or the world around me. Unfortunately, as I got older, the creating stopped
  and any new idea would figuratively collect dust due to "growing up"...and honestly, I wasn't a fan of that. 
  As I enter my 30s, I'm still getting older, but the passion to create is still there. So as I rediscover my creative side again 
  (with the power of "trying" on my side), I want to use this website as a place to display my creative projects and share them with the world. 
  Also, be sure to join my newsletter on the Contact Page for future updates.`;
